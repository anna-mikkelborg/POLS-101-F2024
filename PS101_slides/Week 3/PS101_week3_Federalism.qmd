# Wednesday: The changing nature of American federalism

## Forget about America for a second

## Guess who else had to grapple with these questions...

![Constitutional Convention](constitutional_convention.jpg)

## Review: what is federalism?

Confederation
: states have sovereignty, national government does not

Unitary system
: national government has sovereignty, state governments do not

Federal system
: both state and national governments possess sovereignty

## What this looks like

- The same people and territory are covered by multiple levels of government
- Each level has final authority on some matters
- Each level of government is protected from domination by the other levels
- The national constitution can't be changed without the consent of most subnational governments
- Subnational governments have representation in the national government

## Why not a confederation?

They had already tried that.

## Why not a unitary system?

::: {.center-y}

> "[An] immovable limit was the existence of the thirteen states... The need for a federal rather than a unitary republic was therefore not justified by a principle adduced from general historical experience, much less from political theory. It was just a self-evident fact" (Dahl 2001, 12).

## Still a lot of details to hammer out

**National government powers**

- Coin money
- Regulate interstate and foreign commerce
- Tax imports and exports
- Make treaties and declare war
- Regulate the postal system
- Make all laws "necessary and proper" to fulfill these responsibilities


## Still a lot of details to hammer out

**State government powers**

- Administer elections
- Regulate intrastate commerce
- Establish forms of state and local governments
- Protect public health, safety, and morals
- Everything else not delegated to the national government or denied to the states by the Constitution

## Still a lot of details to hammer out

**Both:** 

- Make and enforce laws
- Administer a judiciary
- Levy taxes
- Borrow money
- Seize property (eminent domain)

## Still a lot of details to hammer out

**Inter-state relations:** 

- States have to accept each other's court decisions, public acts, and contracts
- States have to deliver basic rights and protections to out-of-staters equally
- No restrictions on inter-state trade

## And significant change still occurred over time

Founding-1870s: Series of landmark Supreme Court cases establish national supremacy

1870s-1930s: Detente of dual federalism

1930s-1970s: Cooperative federalism

1970s-present: Competitive (new) federalism

## Towards national supremacy, 1789-1870s

- 1819: *McCulloch v Maryland* $\rightarrow$ **doctrine of implied powers** and **principle of national supremacy**
- 1824: *Gibbons v Ogden* national government has exclusive right to regulate interstate commerce, including navigation
- 1832-1833: Nullification Crisis. Can states nullify trade laws they don't like?
- 1861-1865: Civil War. Union victory solidified national supremacy.

::: {.notes}
- McCulloch: think national bank.
- Gibbons: think steamboats.
- Nullification crisis: think tariffs.
- Post-Civil War, Congress ended states' rights to secede and to nullify federal laws.
- Conditions for readmitting confederate states: ratification of 14th and 15th Amendments
:::

## Detente, 1870s-1930s

- Industrialization $\rightarrow$ rise of corporate power $\rightarrow$ tests of scope of government authority
- Federal and state governments attempted to regulate commerce, but a series of Supreme Court cases limited scope
    - *United States v E.C. Knight:* federal government cannot regulate manufacturing, only commerce
    - *Lochner v New York:* states cannot cap work hours
    
## Both early periods characterized by dual federalism

Dual federalism
: State and national governments have clearly delineated powers and responsibilities

- Textbook says dual federalism was only 1870s-1930s federalism! But it was the plan from the beginning.

## Cooperative federalism, 1930s-1970s

- The Great Depression $\rightarrow$ New Deal $\rightarrow$ FDR forces SCOTUS to accept greater scope of federal government action
    - e.g., *NLRB v Jones and Laughlin Steel:* Congress can regulate manufacturing and labor-management relations
- New era of **cooperative federalism:** increased overlap and coordination between federal and state governments
- States retain flexibility over implementation of federal programs
- But increased federal power led to significant **nationalization** of politics

## Competitive federalism, 1970s-present

aka "new" federalism

- Push back towards decentralization, though not complete
- SCOTUS reversed precedent on expansive view of commerce clause
- National catastrophes (9/11, COVID-19) have weighed towards increased federal power

## Closing thoughts

- There are lots of ways to distribute power
- Each arrangement has had benefits and drawbacks
- Different arrangements have empowered different constituencies

## Remember

- No class on Friday!
- More on Federalism on Monday.

# Monday: Federalism causes strange things to happen

## Review

New Federalism
: A framework for federal government that emphasizes the devolution of power from the federal government back to the states

- Ushered in under Presidents Nixon and Reagan


## Yet both levels of government continue to legislate on overlapping issues

:::{.nonincremental}
- Same-sex marriage
- Immigration
- Identification documents
- Abortion
- Gun control
- Health insurance
- Environmental regulations
:::

## Why?

Factors increasing federal power

1. Creeping categorization
2. Federal preemption

Factors increasing state power

1. Venue shopping
2. Discretionary enforcement
3. The California effect

## Methods of federal funding transfers to states

General revenue sharing
: Grants to states with no strings attached (only in effect 1972-1986)

Block grants
: Grants to states for a specific set of programs, but not specific activities (some strings attached). *e.g.,* TANF ("welfare")

Categorical grants
: Grants to states for a narrow purpose (many strings attached). *e.g.,* Medicaid

---

Creeping categorization
: A process by which Congress adds conditions to existing block grants, causing them to more closely resemble categorical grants, or replaces expiring block grants with categorical grants

## iClicker question

An aside on data visualization: what's wrong with this figure?

:::{.nonincremental}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}
![Figure 3.13. Federal grants to local and state governments](terrible_figure.png)
:::

:::{.column width="65%"}
a. Inappropriate format selected
b. Misleading scaling
c. Variable of interest is not represented visually
d. All of the above

## Federal preemption

- **Preemption laws:** Laws passed by Congress that explicitly limit future legislation by states on the same issue
- SoRelle and Walker: Democratic and Republican Congresses pass preemptions at about equal rates
- But they pass different *kinds:*
  - Ceiling: states cannot pass stricter regulations than the national standard
  - Floor: states cannot pass laxer regulations than the national standard, but can set stricter ones

## Federal preemption

![Floor vs. ceiling preemptions as enacted by party control of House, 1990-2012](floor_ceiling_preemption.png)

## Federal preemption

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Preemption laws:** Laws passed by Congress that explicitly limit future legislation by states on the same issue
- SoRelle and Walker: Democratic and Republican Congresses pass preemptions at about equal rates
- But they pass different *kinds:* ceilings vs. floors
- The parties' stances on "states' rights" depend on which one holds power
- Public opinion is more stable (Rendleman and Rogowski 2024)
:::

## Venue shopping

- Interest groups select the level (and branc) of government that will best allow them to promote the policies they want
- *e.g.,* women's suffrage, civil rights, same-sex marriage, abortion rights and restrictions

:::{.fragment}

|Venue|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|-----|:-------|:--------|
|Federal|Consistent policy nationwide|Costly, gridlock more common|
|State|Can start with sympathetic states|Leads to inconsistent policy nationwide|

:::

## Discretionary enforcement

*e.g.,* Immigration federalism
: State and local action on immigration, a formally national policy issue

- Can be restrictive, like TX SB 4: makes undocumented status a state crime in TX
    - Currently tied up in federal appeals court
- Or the opposite, like CO HB19-1124: state law enforcement cannot arrest or detain individuals on the basis of immigration status
    - Enacted in 2019

## The California effect

- Several states have truly massive economies (and consumer markets)
- Regulations required in California often become the de facto national standard
  - *e.g.,* auto emissions, gas stoves
- Florida effect?
  - *e.g.,* A.P. African American studies curriculum, also gas stoves

If this all feels a little wishy-washy, that's because it is!

# Federalism, power, and democracy

## States as "laboratories of democracy"

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

> “A single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”
-- Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262

## States as "laboratories against democracy"


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Divided government less common $\rightarrow$ less gridlock $\rightarrow$ states can advance policies that would be blocked nationally
- "Race to the bottom" logic of taxation, labor standards, environmental protections
- Lower voter information and turnout $\rightarrow$ greater elite control

## Lived experiences across states can vary drastically

![](nyt_federalism.png){fig-align="center"}

## iClicker question

:::{.nonincremental}
In your opinion, are the experiences of the Nobles and the Huckinses stronger evidence of federalism's failure or success?

a. Failure
b. Success

:::

## Closing thoughts

- The federal structure of government gives rise to a host of interesting dynamics.
- The balance of power between the federal and state governments is always in flux.
- The consequences of federalism are a mixed bag for individual citizens.

## Looking ahead

:::{.nonincremental}
- Civil liberties
- Your first exam is next Friday! Start reviewing now.
